/*
	Release names come in three parts:
	the Catalog Name, the Release Name, and the Item Label.

	The catalog is a whole group of releases for a single project.
	For example, there's a "repeatr" releases catalog.

	The release name is a string attached to the release;
	it's specified by the releaser when creating a new release.

	The item name is a selector used to select a specific ware when there is
	more than one ware published in a single atomic release.
	Usually these are used to specify things like a host architecture for binaries,
	though keywords like "src" and "docs" are also common.
	The set of items in a release is considered immutable once the release is published.
	Generally, there's an expectation in the ecosystem that the set of item labels available
	from each release will be the same: e.g., when upgrading from an older version
	of repeatr, one might expect to jump from "repeatr.io/repeatr:1.0:linux-amd64"
	to "repeatr.io/repeatr:1.1:linux-amd64".

	//
	// Note: it's entirely possible for two steps with different names in a Replay
	// to have identical formulas (and thus identical setupHashes).
	// In this case, both steps may also share identical RunRecords(!), if the
	// original releaser used a formula runner smart enough to notice this
	// and dedup the computation; the steps are still stored separately, because
	// it is correct to render them separately in order to represent the
	// releaser's original intentions clearly.

	// elsewhere (you may look them up by using the Formula.SetupHash).
	//
	// It is forbidden to have two RunRecords in the same step to declare
	// different resulting WareIDs for an output slot
	// if that output slot is referenced by either the final Products
	// or any intermediate "wire"-mode Import.
	// (It's perfectly fine for RunRecords to have differing results for outputs
	// that *aren't* so referenced; an output slot which captures logs, for example,
	// may often differ between runs, but since it's not passed forward, so be it.)

	// FUTURE/REVIEW: we may want to include a concept of "checkpoints":
	// they're named in the same space as steps using formulas,
	// and can be wired roughly the same way...
	// but take a single input wire,
	// and some other step names from which it only collects exit codes,
	// and the checkpoint itself does not need a formula or runrecords.
	// The checkpoint is only considered done when all the other named steps have
	// exited success, and thus can be used to gate flow based on tests in other formulas.
	// You could emulate this with dummy formulas, but
	// Checkpoints just happen to not need execution of a formula themself,
	// and only have a single output ware (which is coincidentally also the input ware),
	// and so benefit from some directness and simplification.
	// They would also be appropriate to highlight slightly differently in a UI.

	A note on storage (on filesystem):

		./{catalogName}/catalog.json
		./{catalogName}/replay/{releaseName}/replay.json
		./{catalogName}/replay/{releaseName}/{stepName-1}.formula
		./{catalogName}/replay/{releaseName}/{stepName-2}.formula
		./{catalogName}/tracks.json # optional; this is an extension

	Why like this?

		- Every catalog deserves its own dir; goes without saying.
		- 'catalog.json' is just about the facts; just names and content.
		- 'replay/*', though we certainly hope you're using repeatr, is
		   full of repeatr opinions.  ('catalog.json' isn't, aside from WareIDs.)
		- Formulas *get their own file* under the replay dirs, so you can easily
		   *directly* `repeatr run` those again, even without the rest of hitch.
		- The path to formulas is entirely human names, so you can tabcomplete to
		   something that's of interest to you.
		- Extensions like "tracks" (an alternative to semver) store their data
		   off to the side; they can reference <Catalog,Release,Item> tuples clearly.

	Todo: runrecord storage not yet shown here.  Pick that (see also review
	comments in the example, below).
