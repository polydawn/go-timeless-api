/*
	Package 'apiutil' contains utility functions and additional types for
	further parsing of Timeless API serialized types.
	These may be used in validation functions,
	and are likely useful for some of the applications in the Timeless Stack
	that implement real heavy lifting,
	but they are not themselves serializable again.
